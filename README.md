# Wine Dataset Analysis

This small project is my entry into the world of analytics and data. I will be analyzing and obtaining insights from the dataset obtained from The University of California Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 12 different variables,

- Fixed acidity: Titratable acidity, sometimes referred to as fixed acidity, is a measurement of the total concentration of titratable acids and free hydrogen ions present in your wine.

- Volatile acidity: Volatile acidity is mostly caused by bacteria in the wine creating acetic acid — the acid that gives vinegar its characteristic flavor and aroma — and its byproduct, ethyl acetate. Volatile acidity could be an indicator of spoilage, or errors in the manufacturing processes — caused by things like damaged grapes, wine exposed to air, and so on.

- Citric acid: Citric acid is generally found in very small quantities in wine grapes. It acts as a preservative and is added to wines to increase acidity, complement a specific flavor or prevent ferric hazes.

- Residual sugar: Residual Sugar, or RS for short, refers to any natural grape sugars that are leftover after fermentation ceases. Composed of fructose and glucose, the natural ingredients in grapes. Most of the bacteria becomes alcohol after fermentation, and the remaining sugar that is not converted is the residual.

- Chlorides: The amount of chlorides present in a wine is usually an indicator of its “saltiness.” This is usually influenced by the territory where the wine grapes grew, cultivation methods, and also the grape type.

- Free sulfur dioxide and Total sulfur dioxide: Sulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO2. It’s the most common preservative used, usually added by wine makers to protect the wine from negative effects of exposure to air and oxygen. Wines with added sulphur dioxide contents usually have “Contains Sulphites” on their labels.

- Density: Also known as specific gravity, it can be used to measure the alcohol concentration in wines. During fermentation, the sugar in the juice is converted into ethanol with carbon dioxide as a waste gas. Monitoring the density during the process allows for optimal control of this conversion step for highest quality wines. Sweeter wines generally have higher densities.

- Sulfates: Sulfates are salts of sulfuric acid. They aren’t involved in wine production, but some beer makers use calcium sulfate — also known as brewers’ gypsum — to correct mineral deficiencies in water during the brewing process. It also adds a bit of a “sharp” taste. Generally, white wine has a higher sulfate content than red wine.

- pH: pH stands for power of hydrogen, which is a measurement of the hydrogen ion concentration in the solution. Generally, solutions with a pH value less than 7 are considered acidic, with some of the strongest acids being close to 0. Solutions above 7 are considered alkaline or basic. The pH value of water is 7, as it is neither an acid nor a base.

- Alcohol: The alcohol content of the wine

- Quality: Comprehensive score of the wine

This dataset contains 4868 observations of 12 characteristics (fixed acidity, volatile acid, citric acid, residual sugar, chloride, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfate, alcohol, and mass). Here, 11 Characteristics are numerical data types that reflect the physical and chemical characteristics of wine, and the last one(quality) is the wine score. Although it is a numerical value, we use the wine’s score as an index to measure quality as a categorical variable.
